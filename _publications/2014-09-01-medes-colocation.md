The world is seeing more sensing and actuating devices deployed in our environment as part of the global digital ecosystem. One issue for perpetually running Internet of Things (IoT) devices is the energy efficiency. Many new IoT devices are running on powerful platforms that have ample computing and memory capacities to support multiple services. One energy saving strategy is therefore to co-locate several services on one device in order to reduce the computing and communication energy cost. Our research proposes the service merging approach for mapping and co-locating many services on one device. The service co-location problem is modeled as the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem. We study the algorithms to transform a service flow to a co-location graph, and then use heuristic algorithms to find the maximum independent set which will be used for the service co-location decisions. The performance of different co-location algorithms are evaluated by simulation in this study.

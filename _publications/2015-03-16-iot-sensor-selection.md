Systems built for future Internet of Things (IoT) may have a large number of intelligent objects with sensing, actuating, and computing capabilities. In a specific context, a smart application deployed in the system needs to meet QoS requirement in order to provide a good experience for users. The Woking middleware use service oriented paradigm to help application developers define the logical functionalities using Flow Based Programs (FBP). Wukong will then map the abstraction of an application onto physical smart devices and actuators. In this paper, we study the QoS oriented mapping algorithm for applications with a set of QoS attributes. After developers specify how each attribute contributes to the overall QoS, Wukong will find the best mapping solution according to the requirement. We formalize the problem as a maximum weighted bipartite problem, and present the algorithm based on the Integer Linear Programming model. We show the algorithm performance by simulation.

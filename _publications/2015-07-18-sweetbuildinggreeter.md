This paper shows how a persuasive interactive system can impact community behavior. SweetBuildingGreeter includes an interactive display and a gumball dispenser with environmental sensors. It provides media and tangible rewards. It has been located in buildingsâ€™ public entry areas to encourage people to be conscious of and to empower saving energy. What makes the system ignored or engaging? The first experiment attracted participants to fill out a questionnaire to dispense candy and display problems which could be fixed in the building. Newcomers to the building filled out the questionnaire, but few returned to do it again. The second experiment provided images of energy savings and was effective at making people aware of energy issues, but it did not change their likelihood of using the system. Soliciting people with sound was more effective. This was especially true in a case where people had earlier negative experiences.

<div style="text-align: justify"> My current research interest is in Design Automation of Embedded Systems, especially the automation with data-driven system modeling approaches. It covers incorporating ML/AI methods to identify potential security issues in systems. For example, side-channel attack detection on additive manufacturing and hardware trojan detection in FPGAs are the ongoing projects in my lab, UCI AICPS Lab. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> While studying master in NTU, I worked on an IoT project, WuKong, a middleware capable of deploying an application onto a set of heterogeneous intelligent objects with different capabilities. My thesis topic is about a service matchmaking scheme that makes the deployment more energy-efficient. In the first year of my master, I worked on a project aimed at building intelligent persuasive systems. I delivered the primitive prototype of Sweetfeedback: a persuasive gumball machine that dispatches candies when a participant helps improve the environment. Afterward, I revamped Sweetfeedback and made it a public interactive unit in order to make it more influential. </div>

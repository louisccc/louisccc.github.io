<div style="text-align: justify"> My research interest is in Design Automation of Embedded Systems, especially the automation with data-driven system modeling approaches. It covers incorporating ML/AI methods to identify potential security issues in systems. For example, side-channel attack detection on additive manufacturing and hardware trojan detection in FPGAs are the ongoing projects in my lab, UCI AICPS Lab. </div><br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> While studying master in NTU, I worked on an IoT project, WuKong, a middleware capable of deploying an application onto a set of heterogeneous intelligent objects with different capabilities. My thesis topic is about a service matchmaking scheme that makes the deployment more energy-efficient. </div>

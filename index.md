<div style="text-align: justify">My research interest is in Design Automation of Embedded Systems, especially the automation with data-driven system modeling approaches. It covers incorporating ML/AI methods to identify potential security issues in systems. For example, side-channel attack detection on additive manufacturing and hardware trojan detection in FPGAs are the ongoing projects in my lab, UCI AICPS Lab.

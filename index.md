Well goes an old saying, though I don't know where it comes from, 

> Life is short, so eat cookies.

Regarding me, I am now a Ph.D student in the University of California, Irvine (UCI). Before coming to united state, I spent four years working as an software engineer in world-renowned company, MediaTek.

My current research interest is in Design Automation of Embedded Systems, especially the automation with data-driven system modeling approaches. It covers incorporating ML/AI methods to identify potential security issues in systems. For example, side-channel attack detection on additive manufacturing and hardware trojan detection in FPGAs are the ongoing projects in my lab, [UCI AICPS Lab](http://aicps.eng.uci.edu/). To summarize, my interests lie on **Machine Learning on Graphs and Its Applications** and can be illustrated as follows.

Some highlighted projects that I am working on:
- **Open-Source Project: [Pykg2vec](https://github.com/Sujit-O/pykg2vec): Python Library for Knowledge Graph Embedding Methods**
- **Research Project: [DCC](https://github.com/deepcurator/DCC): Deep Code Curator**
- **Research Project: Sabotage Attack Detection for Additive Manufacturing Systems**

While studying master in NTU, I worked on an IoT project, WuKong, a middleware capable of deploying an application onto a set of heterogeneous intelligent objects with different capabilities. My thesis topic is about a service matchmaking scheme that makes the deployment more energy-efficient. In the first year of my master, I worked on a project aimed at building intelligent persuasive systems. I delivered the primitive prototype of Sweetfeedback: a persuasive gumball machine that dispatches candies when a participant helps improve the environment. Afterward, I revamped Sweetfeedback and made it a public interactive unit in order to make it more influential. Below is a list of research projects I was working on during my master,
- **Project: WuKong - Intelligent Self-Reconfigurable Middleware for new M2M programming paradigm [site](https://newslabntu.github.io/wukong4iox/)**
- **Project: Sweet Building Greeter - A Demonstration of Persuasive Computing Design on Public Space**
- **Project: Sweetfeedback - A desktop sensor/effector platform for Persuasive Computing [site](http://www.sweetfeedback.com/)**
